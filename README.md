Curriculum Vitae (LaTeX)
===============

### Template Structure
I like clean code. To make it look nice and neat I used a lot of `\newcommand`'s. Be sure you read the preamble carefully so that you understand how the custom envionments work. 

**Warning:** Some of these commands are brand new and I haven't finished implementing them throughout the entire CV. So half the sections contain the nice clean code, the other half is still ugly. Will finish that very soon. 

### Fonts: LaTeX vs. XeLaTeX
Currently, this is set up to use system fonts that I have (e.g. Baskerville). You may not have the same fonts I do, so you will have to change that or it wont typeset. If you do choose to use system fonts that you do have, you must typeset with XeLaTeX. Vanilila LaTeX does not have system font support. If you'd like to use LaTeX, delete everything in the preamble that has to do with fonts, and examine the custom commands carefully, as they may contain references to some of the fonts that I used.
